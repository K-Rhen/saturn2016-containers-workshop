# SATURN 2016 Workshop on Containers and Software Architecture

Write once run anywhere.  Over the years many technologies and design paradigms have made this promise.  Virtual containers such as Docker and CoreOS may finally be the technology that truly delivers on the promise.  But with all new powers developers must be prepared for a new set of responsibilities.  Containers may bring portability but with it comes new abstractions.  Scalability might be achievable but only when certain patterns are followed.  Like all the magic that came before it, an improper understanding of the abstractions underneath brings calamity.

The workshop took place on Monday, May 2, 2016 in San Diego, CA as part of the [SATURN 2016 conference on software architecture](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/saturn/2016/).

## Workshop Outcomes

The workshop was conducted as a series of discussions following [this general ageneda](agenda.md).
