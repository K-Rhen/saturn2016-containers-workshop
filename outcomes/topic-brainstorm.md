# Containers Workshop: initial brainstorming

1. What is a container? [D]
2. Security - is it better in a container-based system? [C]
3. Container orchestration - scaling, deployment, management [A]
4. Containers and Microservices - do they enable each other?
5. Deployment - cloud deployment - does this enable software to "go anywhere"? [A]
6. IT system patterns - how we build systems that work in the data center ... microservices may be a "big version of daemons" [F1]
